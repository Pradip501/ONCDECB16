# Orchestration Tool: Kubernetes

## Introduction to Kubernetes
Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Initially developed by Google, Kubernetes is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It has become the industry standard for container orchestration.

## Why Do We Need an Orchestration Tool?
With the rise of containerized applications, managing containers in production environments has become increasingly complex. Challenges include:
- **Scalability**: Managing hundreds or thousands of containers.
- **Load Balancing**: Ensuring even distribution of traffic across containers.
- **High Availability**: Preventing downtime by managing container failures automatically.
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficiently utilizing system resources like CPU and memory.
- **Service Discovery**: Making it easy for containers to communicate with each other.
- **Automation**: Reducing manual intervention for repetitive tasks like deployment and scaling.

Container orchestration tools like Kubernetes address these challenges by automating the deployment, scaling, and operation of containers, making them essential in modern DevOps workflows.

## Why Kubernetes?
Kubernetes has emerged as the preferred orchestration tool for several reasons:
1. **Open Source**: Vendor-neutral and community-driven.
2. **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale workloads.
3. **Portability**: Works across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.
4. **Extensibility**: Highly customizable through APIs and plugins.
5. **Resilience**: Automatic healing of failed containers and rescheduling.
6. **Comprehensive Ecosystem**: Supported by a wide range of tools and platforms.

## Architecture of Kubernetes
Kubernetes employs a master-worker architecture:

### 1. **Master Node**
Responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster. Components include:
- **API Server**: Facilitates communication between users and the cluster.
- **Controller Manager**: Maintains the desired state of the cluster (e.g., ensuring the correct number of pods).
- **Scheduler**: Assigns workloads to worker nodes based on resource availability.
- **etcd**: A distributed key-value store for cluster state data.

### 2. **Worker Node**
Responsible for running application workloads. Components include:
- **Kubelet**: Communicates with the API server and manages containers.
- **Kube-proxy**: Handles networking and routing of requests to containers.
- **Container Runtime**: Runs the containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

### 3. **Pods**
- The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- Encapsulates one or more containers, along with shared storage and network.

### 4. **Additional Components**
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: For managing configuration and sensitive data.
- **Ingress**: For HTTP and HTTPS routing.
- **Namespaces**: For isolating resources within a cluster.

## Lifecycle of the Pods
1. **Pending**: The pod is accepted but waiting for resource allocation.
2. **Running**: The pod has been assigned to a node, and containers are running.
3. **Succeeded**: All containers have terminated successfully.
4. **Failed**: Containers in the pod have terminated with errors.
5. **Unknown**: The pod state cannot be determined.

## Cluster Creation Methods
### 1. **Minikube**
- Ideal for local development and testing.
- Creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster on a local machine.

### 2. **Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**
- Uses Docker containers to simulate Kubernetes clusters.
- Lightweight and ideal for CI/CD pipelines.

### 3. **Kubeadm**
- A tool for creating and configuring production-grade Kubernetes clusters.
- Requires manual setup of infrastructure and networking.

### 4. **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**
- Managed Kubernetes service by AWS.
- Simplifies cluster creation and management.

### 5. **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)**
- Managed Kubernetes service by Google Cloud.
- Deep integration with Google’s ecosystem.

### 6. **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)**
- Managed Kubernetes service by Microsoft Azure.
- Integrated with Azure’s monitoring and identity solutions.

## Conclusion
Kubernetes simplifies the management of containerized applications in complex environments. Understanding its architecture and lifecycle is fundamental for effectively deploying and managing workloads. Additionally, selecting the right cluster creation method depends on your use case, whether it’s local development or production deployment.

# Kubernetes: Cluster Creation and Management

## Create a Cluster Using EKS
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) simplifies the process of running Kubernetes on AWS. Below is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - AWS CLI installed and configured with proper IAM permissions.
   - `eksctl` installed for cluster creation.
   - `kubectl` installed for managing the cluster.

2. **Cluster Creation**:
   ```bash
   eksctl create cluster \
     --name my-cluster \
     --region us-west-2 \
     --nodegroup-name my-nodes \
     --node-type t3.medium \
     --nodes 2 \
     --nodes-min 1 \
     --nodes-max 3 \
     --managed
   ```
   - `--name`: Specifies the cluster name.
   - `--node-type`: Defines the instance type for nodes.
   - `--managed`: Indicates that AWS manages the node group.

3. **Verification**:
   - Confirm the cluster is running:
     ```bash
     eksctl get cluster
     ```

## Install kubectl and Access the EKS Cluster

1. **Install kubectl**:
   - On Linux:
     ```bash
     curl -o kubectl https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/latest/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
     chmod +x ./kubectl
     sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin
     ```
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     kubectl version --client
     ```

2. **Configure kubectl for EKS**:
   - Update your kubeconfig file:
     ```bash
     aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name my-cluster
     ```
   - Test connection:
     ```bash
     kubectl get svc
     ```

## Introduction to Pods and Services

### Pods
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, encapsulating one or more containers with shared resources like storage and network.

- **Lifecycle**:
  - Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed → Terminated

- **Use Cases**:
  - Running a single application container.
  - Running multiple containers that share resources and are tightly coupled (e.g., sidecar patterns).

### Services
Services provide stable networking and expose Pods to other applications or external traffic.

- **Types of Services**:
  1. **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service within the cluster.
  2. **NodePort**: Exposes the service on each node’s IP at a static port.
  3. **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service to the internet using a cloud provider’s load balancer.

## Main Container and Sidecar Containers

### Main Container
The primary container that serves the main purpose of the application. Examples include application servers or web servers.

### Sidecar Container
An auxiliary container that provides supporting functionalities, such as logging, monitoring, or proxying.

- **Examples**:
  - A logging container (e.g., Fluentd) that collects logs from the main container.
  - A proxy container (e.g., Envoy) that manages network traffic.

- **Benefits**:
  - Decouples concerns and improves maintainability.
  - Allows independent scaling and updates.

- **Implementation** (Sample Pod with a Sidecar):
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: example-pod
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: main-app
      image: nginx
    - name: sidecar-logging
      image: fluentd
  ```

## Run First Pod Using kubectl

1. **Create a Pod**:
   ```bash
   kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never
   ```
   - `--image`: Specifies the container image.
   - `--restart=Never`: Ensures the creation of a standalone Pod.

2. **Verify Pod**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

3. **View Pod Details**:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod nginx-pod
   ```

---

## Expose Pod Using kubectl expose

1. **Expose Pod**:
   ```bash
   kubectl expose pod nginx-pod --type=NodePort --port=80
   ```
   - `--type=NodePort`: Exposes the Pod on a static port.
   - `--port`: Specifies the port the Pod listens on.

2. **Get Service Details**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get svc
   ```

3. **Access the Pod**:
   - Use the `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>` to access the exposed Pod.

---

## In-Depth: kubectl Usage

### Common Commands
- **View Resources**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  kubectl get svc
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

- **Apply Changes**:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f <manifest-file>.yaml
  ```

- **Delete Resources**:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
  ```

- **Debugging**:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
  ```

### Resource Management
- Scaling Deployments:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=3
  ```

- Viewing Pod Events:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```

---

## Pod Management

### Key Operations
1. **Creating Pods**:
   Using YAML manifests to define desired state.
2. **Deleting Pods**:
   Graceful termination using `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`.
3. **Monitoring Pods**:
   - `kubectl top pod` for resource usage.
   - `kubectl get pod -o wide` for detailed status.

# Orchestration Tool: Kubernetes

## Kubernetes Networking: Intra-Pod and Inter-Pod Communication

Kubernetes networking is fundamental for ensuring smooth communication between various components, including pods, services, and external clients. It provides flexible networking configurations for intra-pod and inter-pod communication.

### Intra-Pod Communication
- **Definition**: Intra-pod communication refers to the communication between containers within the same pod.
- **Mechanism**: Containers in a pod share the same network namespace, which means they:
  - Share the same IP address.
  - Can communicate directly using `localhost` and exposed container ports.

#### Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: main-container
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  - name: sidecar-container
    image: redis
    ports:
    - containerPort: 6379
```
In this example:
- The `main-container` and `sidecar-container` share the same IP address.
- The `main-container` can access Redis by connecting to `localhost:6379`.

### Inter-Pod Communication
- **Definition**: Inter-pod communication refers to the communication between pods.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Kubernetes assigns each pod a unique IP address.
  - Pods communicate directly using these IP addresses or via Kubernetes services.
  - Kubernetes ensures a flat network model where all pods can communicate without NAT.

#### Example:
- Pod A wants to access Pod B:
  - Pod A connects to Pod B's IP and exposed port directly.
  - Alternatively, Pod A connects via a Kubernetes service for Pod B.

### Kubernetes Service Types for Networking

#### 1. **ClusterIP**
- Default service type.
- Exposes the service only within the cluster.
- Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: clusterip-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

#### 2. **NodePort**
- Exposes the service on a static port on each node.
- Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nodeport-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 30007
```

#### 3. **LoadBalancer**
- Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.
- Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: loadbalancer-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

## Key Networking Components

### 1. Pod IP
- Each pod gets a unique IP address within the cluster.
- Enables direct communication between pods without port conflicts.

### 2. Container Port
- The port exposed by the container inside the pod.
- Used for intra-pod communication.

### 3. Node IP
- IP address of the Kubernetes node.
- Used when accessing services exposed via NodePort or LoadBalancer.

### 4. Node Port
- A static port on the node that forwards traffic to the service.
- Example: Node IP + Node Port allows access to services from outside the cluster.

### 5. LoadBalancer
- Integrates with cloud provider load balancers to expose services externally.
- Automatically assigns external IPs for access.

## Examples

### Accessing a Pod Directly
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
- Accessing directly via Pod IP:
  - `curl <POD_IP>:80`

### Accessing a Service via NodePort
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nodeport-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 30001
```
- Access:
  - `http://<NODE_IP>:30001`

### Accessing a Service via LoadBalancer
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-loadbalancer-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```
- Access:
  - External IP provided by the load balancer.
  - `http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:80`
