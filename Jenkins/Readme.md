# Jenkins Essentials üöÄ

## üåü Introduction to CI Process

### What is Continuous Integration (CI)?
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code into a shared repository. Each integration is automatically verified by:

- **Automated Build Processes** üì¶
- **Automated Testing** ‚úÖ

This ensures the early detection of integration issues and maintains a high-quality codebase.

### Benefits of CI
- üïí **Faster Feedback Loop**: Detect issues early.
- üîí **Improved Code Quality**: Continuous testing and validation.
- ü§ù **Collaboration**: Teams work cohesively.
- üìà **Efficiency**: Streamlined development workflow.

## üåê Difference Between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment

| Aspect                        | Continuous Delivery üöö                             | Continuous Deployment üöÄ                              |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                | Ensures code is always in a deployable state.    | Automatically deploys every change to production.|
| **Deployment Trigger**        | Manual approval for production release.          | Fully automated without manual intervention.     |
| **Use Case**                  | Suitable for environments requiring compliance.  | Ideal for rapid release environments.            |
| **Automation Level**          | High, except production deployment.              | Fully automated, end-to-end.                     |

## üß∞ Introduction to Jenkins

### What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for:
- **Building** üõ†Ô∏è
- **Testing** üß™
- **Deploying** üöÄ applications in a CI/CD pipeline.

### Why Jenkins?
- üåç **Extensive Community Support**: A vast plugin ecosystem.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-Platform**: Runs on various OS (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- üìà **Scalable**: From small teams to large enterprises.
- üîå **Integration**: Easily integrates with version control systems and build tools.

### Core Features
- üéõÔ∏è **Pipeline as Code**: Automate your workflows using Jenkinsfile.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Plugins**: Extend functionality with 1,500+ plugins.
- üìä **Monitoring**: Track builds and test results in real-time.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security**: Role-based access control and integration with SSO.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installing Jenkins Server

### Prerequisites
1. A server with **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)** OS. üêß
2. **Java** installed (Jenkins requires Java 11 or later). ‚òï

### Steps to Install Jenkins

#### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Update Your System
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

#### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Install Java
```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
```
Verify Java installation:
```bash
java -version
```

#### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Add Jenkins Repository
```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```

#### Step 4Ô∏è‚É£: Install Jenkins
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
```

#### Step 5Ô∏è‚É£: Start and Enable Jenkins Service
```bash
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

#### Step 6Ô∏è‚É£: Access Jenkins Web Interface
1. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://<your-server-ip>:8080
   ```
2. Retrieve the initial admin password:
   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```
3. Complete the setup wizard and install suggested plugins.
